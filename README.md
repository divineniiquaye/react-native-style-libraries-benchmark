# React Native Style Libraries Benchmark

Original reproducer was created by @tj-mc: https://github.com/tj-mc/styled-components-native-perf-reproducer

This is an Expo SDK 52 App reproducer to demonstrate the performance difference between popular style libraries and react-native built-in styling.

Tests include React Native [StyleSheet](https://reactnative.dev/docs/stylesheet), [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), [Tamagui](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui), [NativeWind](https://github.com/marklawlor/nativewind), [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion), [Zephyr](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-zephyr), [Dripsy](https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy), [fast-styles](https://github.com/fedemartinm/fast-styles), [Tailwind React Native Classnames(twrnc)](https://github.com/jaredh159/tailwind-react-native-classnames), Shopify's [restyle](https://github.com/Shopify/restyle) and [react-native-unistyles](https://github.com/jpudysz/react-native-unistyles) 

Feel free to fork or PR this repo with improvements or to include other styling libraries.

### ***Note: Test scores may vary between different machines with different hardware***

> `Restyle` scores are remarkably impressive. however `react-native-unistyles` latest **beta (v3)** version is significantly slower.

250 items are rendered in `Array.map` and it's a **basic** test in DEV mode. When more features of each library are added (eg. media queries etc) as your project grows the measurements may vary by a lot.
